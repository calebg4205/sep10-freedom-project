# Entry 2: Chess in hardware and software
##### 11/30/23


To further understand how technology affects chess we must examine the specific technologies in chess. The hardware in chess has always been paired with software. The biggest example of this is chess computers. Chess computers are advanced machines that were first introduced to the world in 1958 through the [IBM 704](https://www.computerhistory.org/chess/mov-433190c26dd21/). This revolutionary piece of technology took up almost a whole room. Still this computer was no match for the world's best chess players. Chess software was continuously updated. Software changed forever when [deep blue](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/20-years-after-deep-blue-how-ai-has-advanced-since-conquering-chess/) came on the scene. According to an article by Stanford titled "[deep blue](https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/apps/deepBlue.html)" chess computers use an algorithm to determine whether or not a move is good. The computer searches a database of hundreds of games to find the best move. Soon the world was shocked when Deep Blue was able to defeat the former World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov. Ever since that moment, chess computers have taken off in skill level. Today a chess computer of your laptop would be able to easily define the best player in the world. In the past software in chess was deeply connected to the hardware. Today hardware has started to become less necessary to run a very skilled chess computer.


### Engineering design process
I am currently in a spot where I am trying to create a solution to the problem, "Why is chess not being represented in an exciting way". Chess history is one that fascinates me and I would like to move away from the stigma the game has and towards the intricacies the game provides. Currently, I am trying to tackle the problem of how chess websites look and why they seem so unprofessional.


### Skills


#### How to learn
During the duration of this course I feel behind quite a bit. I struggled with some personal problems causing me to miss class. I was forced to do the assignment on my own and try my best to complete it. I was able to use the skills I learned throughout the semester and google effectively, read and comprehend, and finally follow instructions on my own.


#### Time Management
This semester I really struggled to manage my time. I never prioritize assignments and struggle to do work. I felt as if my time was being wasted on easy assignment. Now I understand the purpose of each assignment. I hope that in the new semester I will be able to manage time more effectively now that I have a planner.
