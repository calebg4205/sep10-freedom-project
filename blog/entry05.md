### Learning Jquery


When I began learning Jquery over a month ago, the task was daunting. I feared the complexity would make it impossible for me to understand it. Still every Wednesday night I watched a video on Jquery and tinkered. The first thing I learned was how cool Jquery was. I began learning fade and different animations. I was confused by how Javascript connected to HTML and CSS. I then realized the Jquery was similar to HTML in terms of classes. When I added a class I was able to connect it. I made a fade button from scratch which quickly became my favorite animation.
```javascript


function func1()
{
    $("#img1").fadeToggle(3000);
}


```


Suddenly, Fade was always one of the first things I learned. My next task was to work  with different animations and all I had to learn was the syntax. I became familiar with Hide and Show, as well as background color changes.




Then my greatest challenge came when traversing branches with Jquery. Traversing is when you go down a HTML branch and add certain elements to each part of the branch. I worked for week on traversing including many times where I avoided it. I didn't see the advantages of traversing a branch. Finally, I took on the challenge and worked all the way through traversing. I successfully traversed a branch multiple times. This allowed me to feel like I was finally able to use Jquery in a website.


### Engineering Design process


I am currently ready to begin the 5th stage of the engineering design process(Develop a prototype). I am ready to begin making my website to help solve my main problem with chess: Chess websites are too messy and make each chess tournament less reputable. My website will help educate those on chess and try to lead more people to chess.


### Skills


When i began learning Jquery I learned **researching skills**. I had to learn that I can't understand every piece of information. Some Jquery concepts were too hard for me to understand. I had to accept that not everything was important to learn. My notes had become condensed solely to what I wanted to use and what I couldn't do. Since I never learned Javascript, I had trouble understanding everything about Jquery. I learned how to sort through information that I want and understand.


The Second Skill I learned is **How to deal with failure**. Without Javascript I failed over and over again. I kept getting errors and didn't understand any of the syntax. Still I learned how to move forward and think through my problems. I learned that Javascript is very similar and I can use logic and reason to solve my problems. My research also came in handy to solve all my questions and syntax errors.
