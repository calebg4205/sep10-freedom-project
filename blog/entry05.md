### Learning Jquery

When I began learning Jquery over a month ago, the task was daunting. I feared the complexity would make it impossible for me to understand it. Still every Wendsday night I watched a video on Jquuery and tinkered. The first thing I learned was how cool Jquery was. I began learning fade and diffrent animations. I was connfused by how Javascript connected to HTML and CSS. I then realized the Jquery was similar to HTML in terms of classes. When I added a class I was able to connect it. I made a fade button from scratch which quickly became my favoriot animation.
```javascript

function func1()
{
    $("#img1").fadeToggle(3000);
}

```

Suddenly when tinkering fade was always one of the first things I wrote down. My next task was to work  with diiffernt animations and all I had to learn was the syntax. I became fimilar with Hide and Show, as well as background color changes.


Then my greates challenge came when traversing branches with Jquery. Traversing is when you go down a HTML branch and add certain elements to each part of the branch. I worked for week on traversing including many times where I avoided it. I didn't see the davntages of traversing a branch. Finally, I took on the challge and worked all the way through traversing. I successfully traversed a branch muliple times. This allowed me feel like I was able to finally use Jqeury in a webiste.

### Engineering Design process

I am currently ready to beign the 5th stage of the enginnering deign process(Devlop a prototype). I am ready to begin making my websote to help solve my main problem with chess: Chess webistes are too messy and make each chess tournament less reputable. My wesbite wil help educate those on chess and try and lead people more people too chess.
