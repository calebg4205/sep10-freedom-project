### Recap
During the first and second blog I talked a lot about the probelms within the chess community withou offering any solutions. I did my research and gathered background information to make an informed desision on the solution. In summary th probelm is _How can we present chess in a much more professinal way?_

### Ideas for chess
- A unified system to see all the tournaments in your area
- A website to help promote chess by giving out grants to sponsor more free tournaments
- A way to incorporate real-life chess teachings into an AI computer that can replace those teachings for millions of people
### A timeline of software and hardware in chess
- It all started in 1945 when genius and war hero Alan Turing theorized that one-day computers would play "very good chess"
- In 1951 [Deintrich Prinz](https://www.computerhistory.org/chess/first-tests/) created the first chess program to ever run
- Finally, in 1957 Alex Berinsteen was able to run [IBM 704](https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=5508) and it beat a human player
- Then chess computer were held at a stand still untill 1980 when chess hardware became prominet. The [Boris Handriod](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Boris) came into fruition. The hand was able to move and play chess againnst another human! This model was extremly fraglie and sadly was never mass-produced.
- With the invention of the internet [chessmaster 2000](https://www.chess.com/terms/chessmaster-game) became on of the best selling chess programs in teh world. Suddenly people with a computer were able to play chess online.
- Then in 1993 chess software really took off the [Internet chess server](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess/The-time-element-and-competition) was launched. This was the first time people from all over the world where able to play with each other. Chess became a community game and not just a solo game.
- Then chess software and hardware was never the same, [Deep blue](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/20-years-after-deep-blue-how-ai-has-advanced-since-conquering-chess/) was able to defeat the Former World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov. He was the best player in the world at the time and this meant that chess computers were suddenly better than all humans on earth.

### What does the future of chess hold
Chess will always be a complicated and unqiue game. Now that AI are far better than anay human we can use them to learn and expland the game. I belive that AI are not a hinderace to ches but a help. I think we could use AI to help teach people the game and get them interested. I also think we need to unify chess as a community. If we were able to but ever rated tournament that happens on one website then more people would go to tournaments. I think it's extremely important the Ches community unites to allow te game to learn and grow from these new technologies.
### Engineering design process
I am currenly at the 4th step of the Engineering desgin process. I am currenly offering specifc solutions to help unite the game. I think once I create a protype I will be able to test it and see what the game needs more of.

### Skills
#### Research
As it turns out, i ran into a lot of teh probelms I was trying to solve. Some website were not made professionally or were simply nor credible. I had to use some questionable soruces since this topic is not spoken on often. I leaned the importance of reading an entire article and deciding weather it is realible or not.

#### Time management
I struggled this semester to keep up with all my work. I had a lot of changes in my life which affected my schoolwork. I learned this semester how to prioritize different works and the importance of not falling behind in classes.
