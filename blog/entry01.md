### Why choose chess
Chess has always meant so much to me. I learned to play when I was 5 and from then on my life changed. I devoted a significant part of my life to trying to understand and get better at the game. It feels like an appropriate topic for me to choose to honor the game that had given me so much. I have long watched a technology gets inccreasnly incoprated in the chess world but I want to expolre how it can further expand how chess is played.

In order to understand the furture of the game I thought I should understand the past. I read a Britanica article about [Chess history](https://www.britannica.com/topic/chess/History). Then I went thorugh the eveloution of the game. I read about how since the game kicked off the greats like [Paul Morphy](https://worldchesshof.org/chess-hall-of-fame/paul-morphy) and [Bobby Fisher](https://worldchesshof.org/hof-inductee/robert-bobby-james-fischer). The game has always facinated people who have done thier best to understand and create a complete guide to understand chess. Currently players like [Magnus Carlsen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Magnus-Carlsen) and [Ding Liren](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ding-Liren) are creatomh history for chess and I want to explore who technology ha helped them and what it can countiue to do for them.
