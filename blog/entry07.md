## Creating my MVP (Minimal viable project)
Creating my MVP was a challenge just to get all the informaiton I wanted onto a page. I started by downloading a [bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/template/full-width-pics) to try and cut my work in half. I enjoyed working in CSS but the bootstrap template I selected had eveything I wanted and more. Once I unzipped the file I began constimuzation of my webiste. I chnaged the color of the navbar to red before deciding I liked the orgnial color. I added my HSTAT banner I created after bcomign President of ches club. Then I added all my informetion about [Chess history](https://www.houseofstaunton.com/history-of-chess) and the [hardware of chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess), and finally added the [software in chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_software). I worked on collecting pictures and adding my future idea. I added pictures and attacked a lot of then to use Jquery.
