## Creating my MVP (Minimal Viable Project)
Creating my MVP was a challenge, especially when trying to get all the information I wanted onto a page. I started by downloading a [Bootstrap template](https://startbootstrap.com/template/full-width-pics) to try and cut my work in half. I enjoy working with CSS, but the Bootstrap template I selected had everything I wanted and more. Once I unzipped the file, I began customizing my website. I changed the color of the navbar to red before deciding I liked the original color. I added the HSTAT banner I created after becoming President of the chess club. Then, I added all my information about [chess history](https://www.houseofstaunton.com/history-of-chess), the [hardware of chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_chess), and finally, the [software in chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_software). I worked on collecting pictures and adding my future ideas. I added pictures and used a lot of them with jQuery. Soon, I created my navbar, and I had an MVP.

## Engineering Design Process
I created my prototype and was now ready to send it out to the public. I developed my solution and then prepared to present it to my classmates for testing.

## Skills
#### Overcoming Challenges
It was very difficult to take my template and turn it into my own. There was so much I didn't understand, but I used the inspect tool to see what the code did. I spent hours inspecting and adding comments to the CSS to understand its functionality. I also added divs of my own and used inspect to see if they worked. It was a lot of work, but thanks to my endurance, I was able to do it.
