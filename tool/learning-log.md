# Tool Learning Log 4

Tool: Jquery

---

3/20/2024:
* I began to read the [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_hide_show.asp) article on Jquery affects to see how they could spruce on my webpage
  * The fade and slide made me interested
  * It was challeging to try and work with Javascript with no prior experience

  ``javascript
$("#chess").click(function(){
  $("p").hide();
});

$("#knight").click(function(){
  $("p").show();
});
``
3/24/2024:
* I continued to tinker with the effect Jquery alloed me to play with
 * Perhaps my next learning log will include a tutorial on javascript
 * The effects bring a lot of cool things to my website
 * Can I include this in any projects to see it in a real workspace?
