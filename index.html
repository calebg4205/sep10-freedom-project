                            Chess, one of the world's most popular games, has a rich history that stretches back over a thousand years. Originating in India around the 6th century AD, the earliest form of chess, known as chaturanga. From India, the game spread on the silk road, where it evolved into the game we know today. By the 10th century, chess had reached Europe, where it continued to develop. Roy lopez, a Spanish polymath, studied the game for many years. He allowed the game to grow to become one of the staples of world.

                              The game grew with many notable players such as Paul morphy and Jose Capablanca contributing much to the game. Then everything changed in the 20th century when FIDE was created. They became the international governing body on all chess matters. They helped allow for many players to grow such as Bobby Fisher, Gary kasporov, and the famous Magnus Carelson.

                        <h2>Software in Chess</h2>
                        <p class="lead">To understand how technology affects chess we must examine the specific technologies in chess. The hardware in chess has always been paired with software. The biggest example of this is chess computers. Chess computers are advanced machines that were first introduced to the world in 1958 through the IBM 704. This revolutionary piece of technology took up almost a whole room. Still this computer was no match for the world's best chess players. Chess software was continuously updated. Software changed forever when deep blue came on the scene. According to an article by Stanford titled "deep blue" chess computers use an algorithm to determine whether or not a move is good. The computer searches a database of hundreds of games to find the best move. Soon the world was shocked when Deep Blue was able to defeat the former World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov. Ever since that moment, chess computers have taken off in skill level. Today a chess computer of your laptop would be able to easily define the best player in the world. In the past software in chess was deeply connected to the hardware. Today hardware has started to become less necessary to run a very skilled chess computer.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Chess will always be a complicated and unique game. Now that AI is far better than any human we can use them to learn and expand the game. I believe that AI is not a hindrance to chess but a help. I think we could use AI to help teach people the game and get them interested. I also think we need to unify chess as a community. If we were able to but ever rated tournament that happens on one website then more people would go to tournaments. I think it's extremely important the Chess community unites to allow the game to learn and grow from these new technologies.</p>
